Overview
NetRunner is an advanced tool that integrates OpenAI's GPT to perform automated tasks on a Kali Linux system with sudo privileges. By inputting an objective, NetRunner leverages the capabilities of Kali Linux and its suite of tools to achieve the desired outcome using AI-driven commands.

Key Features
AI-Driven Objectives: Specify your goal, and let NetRunner devise a plan using GPT intelligence.
